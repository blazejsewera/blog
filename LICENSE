This work is licensed by default under two licenses:
- GPL-3.0; and
- CC-BY-SA-4.0;
depending on a file.

The full text of the GPL-3.0 license can be found in `LICENSE-GPL-3.0` file.
The full text of the CC-BY-SA-4.0 can be found in `LICENSE-CC-BY-SA-4.0` file.

Despite the Blog Post files, defined in the next paragraph,
all files are licensed under GPL-3.0,
unless clearly specified otherwise in a comment at the beginning of the file.

A Blog Post file is a Markdown (1), MDX (2), Astro (3), or HTML (4) file
that is placed in the `src/pages` directory.
By default, Blog Post files are licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0,
unless clearly specified otherwise in the Frontmatter (5),
a Meta Tag (6), or a comment at the beginning of the Blog Post file.
By convention, the license will be specified as an SPDX License Identifier (7),
in a `license` field, or similar, unequivocal field.
Because the rendered blog post content is based solely on the Blog Post file,
the resulting web page's content is licensed under the same license
as the source Blog Post file.
The rendered blog post web page has the SPDX License Identifier (7) specified
in its metadata, as well as in its footer.

Unless stated otherwise, Photos (8) are sourced from Unsplash (9),
and therefore the Unsplash License (10) is applicable for them.
