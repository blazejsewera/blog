abstract: |
  You are looking for a job in software engineering.
  Now what? I'll try to present the wisdom that I've gathered
  throughout 3 years of professional software development.
  I'll sprinkle some ideas of the industry's thought leaders,
  and provide some outlook on what to do after reading this article.

  This article is a draft â€” it's some loose ideas in a form of bullet points.
  I wanted to take them out of my head,
  because the season for summer internship hiring has begun,
  so some ideas may be helpful, even unrefined.

- First and foremost, learn to communicate.
- Second, remember that you will write code **for your users**,
  not for your pleasure. Learn to listen to their voice and respect it.
  You want your work to be used. Without user-centric approach,
  you will fail to make your software user-friendly,
  or worse, your software will not solve your users' problems.

- Expose your projects publicly on Github / Gitlab / etc.
  - A link to your Github / Gitlab page in your resume is mandatory.
  - Remember that recruiters don't have much time to go through your projects.
    To counter that:
    - Provide a comprehensive summary of your project in the README.
    - Write about your takeaways from the project in the README.
    - Don't lie! Remember that the code is public, so it can be verified.
      Also, a good recruiter will ask you about your projects on an interview.
  - If you apply for a web development position,
    having your own webpage is always a good idea.
- Prepare for some **serious** learning.
  - The following books can have an enormous impact on how you approach
    software engineering:
    - R. C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Pearson Education, 2008.
    - M. Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code. Addison-Wesley, 2019.
    - R. C. Martin, The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers. Prentice Hall, 2011.
    - E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, and J. Vlissides, Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. Pearson Education, 1994.
    - K. Beck, Test-driven Development: By Example. Addison-Wesley, 2002.
    - K. Beck and C. Andres, Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley Professional, 2004.
    - D. Farley, Modern Software Engineering: Doing What Works to Build Better Software Faster. Addison-Wesley, 2022.
  - Ask a lot of questions.
  - Record answers. Take up a good note-taking practice
    (you can take some ideas from [my article on Second Brain](https://blog.sewera.dev/second-brain)).
  - Stay on top of conferences, talks, blogs, and other forms
    of knowledge transmission mediums.
    - [GOTO Conferences](https://www.youtube.com/@GOTO-).
    - [NDC Conferences](https://www.youtube.com/@NDC).
  - Don't discard old ideas. Some of the "revolutionary" ones
    in modern frameworks or methodologies are actually 20 years old
    or as old as from 1968! See [Old is the New New](https://youtu.be/AbgsfeGvg3E)
    by Kevlin Henney.
- Remember that your main goal is to show what **value** you can give
  for the employer.
  - Look what your potential employers need.
  - In healthy organizations you will be expected to collaborate.
    Show your collaboration skills by communicating well,
    asking good questions, and making others feel comfortable around you.
- Read other developers' stories, but know that every person has their own.
  Read their advice for junior programmers.

- Embrace diverging your skills.
  - Learn basics of frontend, backend, UI design, management,
    and whatever role you may think is "not necessary."
- While you progress through your work, ask for more. Know your value.
  - Record your success stories. Be proud of them.
  - Take lessons in your failures. Don't make the same mistake twice.

but for now, please go to the provided resources
